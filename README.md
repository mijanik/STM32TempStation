# Temperature and Humidity measurement station with display and live chart
The aim of the project is to use the I2C bus to communicate with the microcontroller
display and thermometer/hygrometer for information and overview
graph of the current ambient temperature and humidity. In addition, the interface was used
UART to send the same data to PC.
STM32L4R5ZIT6 microcontroller used on Nucleo-L4R5Zi development board
(Nucleo-144), 0.96‚Äù 128*64 OLED display with SSD1306 driver and the Si7021 temperature and humidity measurement module supporting the I2C bus
